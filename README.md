C++ Projects
============

A few samples of my C++ programming skills acquired in **EC327: Introduction to Software Engineering** at Boston University. My semester culminated with the development of a richly object-oriented, command-line game.

The Projects:
------------
* **Basics** - Some simple functions and programs developed within the first week of class.
* **Recursion** - A series of programs that print patterns and perform calculations recursively. Each example (Q1 and Q2) was coded two ways: one using loops and the other using recursion.
* **Minecraft** - A command-line game based on the Model View Controller (MVC) design paradigm. It features all of the fundamentals of object oriented programming coupled with the use of basic data structures.
